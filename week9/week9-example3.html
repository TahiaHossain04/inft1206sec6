    <h1>Week 9: Example 3</h1>
    <h2>What is your name?</h2>

    <!--We need to have a id number for everytime we use a different type of
    writing tag? Like one for input text, one for input button and one for only h2?
    So we can reference them separately at different times in the JS??-->
    <!--To get the input from the user we use the text field instead of the 
    dialogue pop up box that you get if you use 'input' tag. Doing this will
    directly show the input box on the screen (not as a pop up or external screen)
    that will be right underneath the line that is in h2 tag.-->
    <input id="first-name" type="text">
    <!--Add a next to the text field that is called GO. We are adding id to these so we
    can reference them in the java script file. otherwise, it would not have been necessary.
    It's likw how we use class in html so we can style that particular part of class in CSS-->
    <input id="btn" type="button" value="GO">
    <h2 id="output"></h2> <!--We cannot call a function without declaring it 
    at the top first. So declare it in the JS file always before calling it as 
    parameter in the html file-->
